# computer-vision

Projects showcasing my implementation of several classic computer vision algorithms:

- [Seam carving](seam-carving/carving.ipynb) and [canny edge detection](seam-carving/canny_edges.ipynb)

- [Optical flow](optical-flow/flow.ipynb) from a sequence of images

- [Image stitching](image-stiching/ransac.ipynb) with keypoint detection and RANSAC

These were created as part of a [computer vision](https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/courses/H1IH8SuiZ) course at [York University](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/) and are all implemented in Python using typical libraries (PyTorch, Kornia, SciPy, NumPy).
